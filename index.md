## Optimal transport for data recoding.

In this organization we develop two packages R and Julia. This is an ongoing project

- Julia package [OTRecod.jl](https://github.com/otrecoding/OTRecod.jl)
- R package [OTrecod](https://github.com/otrecoding/OTrecod)

Both packages had been developped by Valérie Garès (INSA Rennes), Jérémy Omer (INSA Rennes), Grégory Gernec (INSERM) and Pierre Navaro (CNRS).

For more information please refer to the preprint:
